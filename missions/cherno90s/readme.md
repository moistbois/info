### About:
Before the turn of the millennium, Chernarus is plunged into a civil war caused by a violent secession. You are within a group of Chernarussians on a daring mission to liberate key enemy sectors scattered across the war-torn landscape of Chernarus and her islands within the Green Sea region. Expect the unexpected as you have to fight against people you once greeted as your neighbors. Good luck!
